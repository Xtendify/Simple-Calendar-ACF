# Simple Calendar - Advanced Custom Fields

Add a [Simple Calendar](https://simplecalendar.io) field to [Advanced Customs Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) (ACF).

The field will print the corresponding calendar chosen among those available using ACF. You can use then Advanced Custom Field template functions to print the corresponding field in your templates, such as `the_field( 'your_simple_calendar_field' );`.

To use this add-on you need both Simple Calendar and Advanced Custom Fields installed and activated. It is compatible with both ACF v4 and v5 or ACF Pro and requires Simple Calendar v3 or higher.
